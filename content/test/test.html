A while ago I wrote a [post][vimpost] about switching back to [Vim][].  Since then
I've written two plugins for Vim, one of which has been officially "released".

A couple of people have asked me if I'd write a guide to creating Vim plugins.
I don't feel confident enough to write an official "guide", but I do have some advice
for Vim plugin authors that might be useful.

Other People Who Know More Than I Do
------------------------------------

Writing two decently-sized Vim plugins has given me some experience, but there are
a lot of people that know far more than I do.  There are two in particular that come
to mind.  I'd love for them to write some guides (or even books) about modern-day Vim
scripting.
